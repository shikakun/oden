"Dashi" is a traditional Japanese soup stock essential for making oden. The ingredients are soaked and gently heated to extract a rich umami flavor, providing a flavorful base for simmering oden's diverse ingredients like konjac, ganmodoki (deep-fried tofu mixed with thinly sliced vegetables), and chikuwa (fish cake).
